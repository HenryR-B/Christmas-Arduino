# Christmas-Arduino

This project consisted of scrolling text on an LCD and a buzzer playing “Rockin’ around the Christmas Tree” on an Arduino Board.
It also has LEDs flashing along with the beat, and the whole thing is controlled by pause and reset buttons coded to act as toggle switches.

The code is available in this *Christmas-Arduino* Repository.
